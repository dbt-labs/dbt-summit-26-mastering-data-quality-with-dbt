### Exercise 2: Custom Generic Tests

1. Create a generic test to assert that a column is type DECIMAL.
   *TIP*: Use Snowflake’s typeof() function

   the default arguments are model and column_name
   furthermore generic tests should exist in generic/

2. Apply your test to the `fct_orders` model in 
   `models/marts/docs/_fct_orders.yml` on the `order_total` column.

3. Build the `fct_orders` model to test your results.
